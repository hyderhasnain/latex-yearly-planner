# latex-yearly-planner
PDF planner designed for e-ink devices.  
Fork of original project by https://github.com/kudrykv  

## New Features/Changes
Note: Currently, some of these new features are currently designed for the "breadcrumb" variation of the planner, not the "mos" version.  
The "mos" version might not work correctly currently.
1. Option to add multiple Journal pages per day.
2. Option to customize Reflect page contents (spots for Journal location and uploaded status)
3. Option to hide the name of the month above the mini calendar on Daily pages to allow room for more hours on the schedule
4. Option to add a title to the first/Cover page
5. Option to add a key/legend to the Year page (used to indicate which days have a certain property, such as days with journal entries)
6. Added margin and formatting YAML file specific for Remarkable Paper Pro tablet
